# CodeSplain - Testing Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive testing for the CodeSplain application, a React-based code explanation tool developed as part of Stephen Grider's "React Testing Library and Jest" course. While the application was created by Stephen Grider, I implemented the complete test suite to ensure reliability and proper functionality.

## Testing Approach

The testing strategy follows modern React testing best practices using Jest and React Testing Library (RTL). The focus is on behavior-driven tests that simulate real user interactions rather than implementation details.

### Testing Technologies

- **Jest** (v6.4.6) - Test runner and assertion library
- **React Testing Library** (v16.0.0) - DOM testing utilities
- **user-event** (v14.5.2) - Simulates user interactions
- **MSW** (Mock Service Worker) - API mocking

## Test Structure

Tests are organized following component structure with a focus on:

1. **Component Rendering** - Verifying UI elements appear correctly
2. **User Interactions** - Testing click events, form submissions, etc.
3. **State Management** - Ensuring state changes work as expected
4. **Error Handling** - Validating proper error displays and handling
5. **Integration Tests** - Testing component interactions

## Key Features Tested

- **Form Components** - Input, Checkbox, Button with various states
- **Authentication Flow** - SignUp/SignIn functionality
- **Navigation** - Routing and breadcrumb components
- **Error States** - Validation and error message display
- **Loading States** - Loading indicators and disabled states during API calls

## Testing Patterns Used

### Component Test Setup

```javascript
function renderComponent({
  prop1 = defaultValue1,
  prop2 = defaultValue2,
} = {}) {
  render(<ComponentUnderTest prop1={prop1} prop2={prop2} />);

  return {
    /* Any utilities needed for tests */
  };
}
```

### Mock Implementation

```javascript
jest.mock(
  "./Component",
  () =>
    function MockComponent(props) {
      return <div data-testid="mock-component">{props.children}</div>;
    }
);
```

### User Interaction Testing

```javascript
test("handles user input correctly", async () => {
  const { user } = renderComponent();
  const input = screen.getByRole("textbox");

  await user.type(input, "test value");
  // Assert expected behavior
});
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run a specific test file
npm test -- ComponentName.test.js

# Watch mode (default)
npm test
```

## Best Practices Implemented

- **Accessible Queries** - Using getByRole, getByLabelText over getByTestId when possible
- **User-centric Testing** - Testing from user perspective
- **Isolated Component Tests** - Mocking dependencies and external services
- **Comprehensive Props Testing** - Testing various prop combinations
- **Error Case Coverage** - Testing both happy and error paths

## Future Improvements

- Add E2E tests with Playwright
- Implement visual regression testing
- Increase test coverage for edge cases
- Add performance testing
